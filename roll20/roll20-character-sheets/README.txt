This archive contains a character sheet and companion script for Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok to be used with roll20.net. This is a BETA implimentation and is not guranteed to be stable, use at your own risk. This README assumes you already have some familiarity with the roll20 environment.

Instructions:

2) From your game home page, go to Settings --> Game Settings

11) Copy the entire text of FotN Companion.js and paste it under the "New Script" tab
12) Change the name of the script to "FotN Companion.js" and press the "Save Script" button
